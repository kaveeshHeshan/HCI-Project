## Introduction
This web design is designed for a existing web application called "Hotel Eva Lanka". This is a university project and this web design is built for academic purpose only. In this project, the web designers have to redesigned a web design for a selected existing web application's web design which has bad user experience with low customer satisfaction.

The existing Hotel Eva Lanka web design has the following issues.
1. Font size to too small to read for the user.
2. Every paragraph is left aligned.
3. Content is not enough for the guests or customers.
4. High Quality Photographs are not used.
5. Bad navigation structure.
6. Structure of content of the web page is not well managed.
7. When a customer click the logo on navigation bar, the page is redirecting to the same page. (After clicking the logo, it should be redirected to the home page).
8. In home page, some links are not working.
9. Color scheme used in existing web design is not attractive.
10. No searching feature included.

So we have come up with a better design by answering the above mentioned issues using some modern technology and knowledge. This project is for that. Thank you.
